# 🚀 **Understanding Task Creation in CrewAI**  

CrewAI allows us to define **tasks** in two ways:  
1️⃣ **Using YAML Configuration (Recommended)** 📝  
2️⃣ **Direct Code Definition (Alternative)** 🖥  

This guide will explain the **Direct Code Definition** method in depth, with **real-world examples** and **detailed code breakdowns**.

# 🎯 **Real-World Use Case: AI-Powered Research & Reporting System**  

Imagine a **company** that needs AI to:  
✅ **Research AI topics** for blog posts 📚  
✅ **Generate detailed reports** based on findings 📊  

Using CrewAI, we can automate:  
- **Researching the latest AI trends** 📡  
- **Generating a well-structured report** 📝  
- **Saving the report in Markdown format** 📄  

This saves **time, effort**, and ensures **high-quality outputs**.

# 🏗 **1. Defining Tasks Directly in Code**  

Instead of using a **YAML file**, we can define tasks **directly in Python** using the `Task` class.  

### ✅ **Step 1: Create a `task.py` File**  
Define **two tasks**:  
🔹 **`research_task`** – Gathers AI-related research.  
🔹 **`reporting_task`** – Creates a detailed report.  

```python
from crewai import Task  # Import the Task class

# Define a research task
research_task = Task(
    description="""
        Conduct a thorough research about AI Agents.
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2025.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI Agents
    """,
    agent=researcher  # Assign to the researcher agent
)

# Define a reporting task
reporting_task = Task(
    description="""
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A fully-fledged report with the main topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
    """,
    agent=reporting_analyst,  # Assign to the reporting analyst agent
    output_file="report.md"  # Save the output as a Markdown file
)
```

# 🔍 **2. Breaking Down the Code**  

### 🛠 **Defining a Task**  
```python
from crewai import Task  # Import the Task class
```
📌 **What This Does?**  
- Imports the **Task** class from **CrewAI**, allowing us to create structured tasks.  

---

### 📌 **Creating the `research_task`**  
```python
research_task = Task(
    description="""
        Conduct a thorough research about AI Agents.
        Make sure you find any interesting and relevant information given
        the current year is 2025.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about AI Agents
    """,
    agent=researcher  # Assign to the researcher agent
)
```
📌 **What This Does?**  
1️⃣ Defines **`research_task`**, which collects information about **AI Agents**.  
2️⃣ **Description** – Clearly states what needs to be done.  
3️⃣ **Expected Output** – Specifies the required format (10 bullet points).  
4️⃣ **Agent** – Assigns the **task to the researcher agent** (AI that handles research).  

---

### 📌 **Creating the `reporting_task`**  
```python
reporting_task = Task(
    description="""
        Review the context you got and expand each topic into a full section for a report.
        Make sure the report is detailed and contains any and all relevant information.
    """,
    expected_output="""
        A fully-fledged report with the main topics, each with a full section of information.
        Formatted as markdown without '```'
    """,
    agent=reporting_analyst,  # Assign to the reporting analyst agent
    output_file="report.md"  # Save the output as a Markdown file
)
```
📌 **What This Does?**  
1️⃣ Defines **`reporting_task`**, which creates a detailed AI report.  
2️⃣ **Description** – The AI should review the research and write an in-depth report.  
3️⃣ **Expected Output** – The report should contain **detailed sections** with Markdown formatting.  
4️⃣ **Agent** – Assigns the task to the **reporting analyst agent** (AI specialized in writing reports).  
5️⃣ **Output File** – Saves the generated report as a **Markdown file (`report.md`)**.

# ⚡ **3. Connecting Tasks to a CrewAI Workflow**  

We now need to **connect tasks and agents** to run the research-reporting pipeline.

### 📂 **Step 2: Create `crew.py`**
This file **registers the AI agents and tasks**.

```python
# src/ai_research/crew.py

from crewai import Agent, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool  # Example research tool
from task import research_task, reporting_task  # Import tasks

# Define AI Agents
researcher = Agent(
    name="AI Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

reporting_analyst = Agent(
    name="AI Reporting Analyst",
    role="Content Creator",
    verbose=True
)

# Register the Crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, reporting_analyst],  # Assign agents
    tasks=[research_task, reporting_task],  # Assign tasks
    process=Process.sequential  # Execute tasks in order
)
```

---

# 🔍 **4. Breaking Down the Crew Code**  

### ✅ **Defining AI Agents**  
```python
researcher = Agent(
    name="AI Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)
```
📌 **What This Does?**  
- Defines an AI agent **"AI Researcher"** specialized in research.  
- Uses a **SerperDevTool()** for AI-powered web research.  
- `verbose=True` – Enables detailed logs for debugging.  

---

### ✅ **Defining the Crew**  
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, reporting_analyst],  # Assign agents
    tasks=[research_task, reporting_task],  # Assign tasks
    process=Process.sequential  # Execute tasks in order
)
```
📌 **What This Does?**  
1️⃣ **Assigns the AI agents** to handle different tasks.  
2️⃣ **Links tasks to agents** (researcher → research, analyst → reporting).  
3️⃣ **Uses a sequential process** (tasks are executed **one after another**).  

---

# 🚀 **5. Running the Research-Reporting AI System**  

### ✅ **Step 1: Run the Crew**
To start the AI workflow, call:

```python
from src.ai_research.crew import crew

crew.kickoff()
```

### ✅ **Step 2: What Happens?**  
1️⃣ **AI Researcher** gathers AI-related information.  
2️⃣ **AI Reporting Analyst** converts research into a structured Markdown report.  
3️⃣ The report is **saved as `report.md`**.  

---

# 🎯 **Final Thoughts**  

✅ **Direct Code Definition** provides more control.  
✅ **Useful for AI-powered research, customer support, automation, and more.**  
✅ **Easier debugging and flexibility compared to YAML.**
