# 🚀 **Integrating Tools with Tasks in CrewAI**  

## 🛠️ **Why Integrate Tools in AI Workflows?**  

AI agents alone may **lack real-time data access** or **specific functionalities**. By integrating **CrewAI Toolkit** and **LangChain Tools**, we can:  

✅ **Enhance AI’s capabilities** (e.g., fetching live data, performing calculations).  
✅ **Improve accuracy** by using **external APIs** like **Serper (Google Search)**.  
✅ **Ensure better interaction** between tasks by referencing previous outputs.

# 🎯 **Real-World Use Case: AI News Researcher**  

### 🌍 **Scenario**  
Imagine you’re building an **AI news summarizer** that fetches the **latest AI news**, extracts key insights, and writes a blog.  

### ❌ **Problems Without Tools**  
- AI **lacks real-time knowledge** (e.g., ChatGPT cannot fetch the latest news).  
- Agents would rely only on **pre-trained knowledge** (which can be outdated).  

### ✅ **Solution Using Tools**  
- We use **SerperDevTool** (Google Search API) to **fetch real-time AI news**.  
- AI then **summarizes** the findings into a structured format.  
- A writing agent uses **these summaries** to create a blog post.

# 🏗️ **Step 1: Create a Task with Tools**  

```python
import os

# 🔐 Set API keys for external tools
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"  # Google Search API from serper.dev

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool  # 🛠️ Importing a search tool

# 🎭 Define an AI agent for research
research_agent = Agent(
  role="Researcher",
  goal="Find and summarize the latest AI news",
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# 🔎 Define a search tool for real-time AI news
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# 📝 Define a task using the search tool
task = Task(
  description="Find and summarize the latest AI news",
  expected_output="A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news",
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]  # ✅ Integrating the search tool
)

# 🏢 Create a Crew and assign the research task
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

# 🚀 Execute the task
result = crew.kickoff()

# 🖨 Print the AI-generated summary
print(result)
```

# 📌 **Breaking Down the Code**  

### 🎯 **Step 1: Setting Up API Keys**  
```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
```
- We set **environment variables** to securely store API keys.  
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` is used for **LLM operations**.  
- `SERPER_API_KEY` allows access to **Google Search** via Serper.  

---

### 🎯 **Step 2: Creating an AI Researcher Agent**  
```python
research_agent = Agent(
  role="Researcher",
  goal="Find and summarize the latest AI news",
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)
```
- **Defines an AI agent** responsible for researching AI trends.  
- **Goal:** Find and summarize the latest AI news.  
- **Backstory:** Mimics a real-world researcher.  

---

### 🎯 **Step 3: Adding a Search Tool**  
```python
search_tool = SerperDevTool()
```
- **SerperDevTool** is an external API that **performs live Google searches**.  
- Allows the AI to **fetch real-time AI news**.  

---

### 🎯 **Step 4: Defining a Task with Tools**  
```python
task = Task(
  description="Find and summarize the latest AI news",
  expected_output="A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news",
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]  # ✅ Uses SerperDevTool for web search
)
```
- **Task Description:** AI must find and summarize the latest AI news.  
- **Expected Output:** A **bullet list** with the **top 5 AI news items**.  
- **Tools Used:** The **search tool** fetches real-time data.  

---

### 🎯 **Step 5: Running the AI Workflow**  
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)
```
- Defines a **Crew** with:  
  - One **research agent**.  
  - One **task** (AI news search).  

```python
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```
- **Executes the CrewAI workflow** and prints the AI-generated summary.  

---

# 🔄 **Step 2: Using Outputs from Previous Tasks**  

In **CrewAI**, the output of one task can be **used as context for another task**. This allows us to **connect multiple tasks logically**.  

✅ **Why use task references?**  
✔ Ensures information flows **smoothly between tasks**.  
✔ Allows different agents to **build on previous work**.  

### 🎯 **Example: Research + Blog Writing Workflow**  

```python
# 📝 Research AI trends
research_ai_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    async_execution=True,  # ✅ Runs in parallel
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# 📝 Research AI Ops trends
research_ops_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI Ops",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI Ops developments",
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# ✍️ Writing task that uses previous research
write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output="Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long",
    agent=writer_agent,  # A different agent for writing
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]  # ✅ Uses previous research
)
```

---

# 📌 **Breaking Down Task References**  

### 🎯 **Step 1: Parallel Research Tasks**  
```python
research_ai_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in AI",
    expected_output="A list of recent AI developments",
    async_execution=True,  # ✅ Runs in parallel
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)
```
- This **fetches recent AI trends** using **Google Search**.  
- `async_execution=True` allows **multiple research tasks to run in parallel**.  

---

### 🎯 **Step 2: Writing a Blog Using Research Data**  
```python
write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output="Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long",
    agent=writer_agent,  
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]  # ✅ Uses previous research
)
```
- Uses **previous research outputs** as **context**.  
- The writing agent **combines AI research and AI Ops research** into a blog.  

---

# 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ **Enhancing AI with tools**  
- CrewAI supports **external tools like SerperDev** for **real-time data retrieval**.  

✅ **Better AI task execution**  
- AI can **search the web**, **fetch APIs**, and **interact with databases**.  

✅ **Task Dependency & Referencing**
