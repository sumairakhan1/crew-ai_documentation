# 🌎 **2. Real-World Example**  

### **📦 Example: AI-Powered Product Categorization**  
Imagine an **e-commerce platform** where products need to be categorized automatically:  
1. **Agent 1** fetches product details.  
2. **Agent 2** categorizes the product based on keywords.  
3. **Agent 3** verifies and saves the result.  

This workflow can be **orchestrated using CrewAI tasks** with specific attributes.  

---

# 🛠 **3. Code Example: Defining a Task with Attributes**  

## **📌 Step 1: Install CrewAI**
```bash
pip install crewai
```

## **📌 Step 2: Import Required Modules**  
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from typing import List, Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel
```

---

## **📌 Step 3: Define a Custom Output Model**  
Let's structure our output using **Pydantic** (optional but useful for structured data).  

```python
class ProductCategoryOutput(BaseModel):
    product_name: str
    category: str
    confidence_score: float
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- The output will contain **product name**, **assigned category**, and **confidence score** (accuracy of categorization).  

---

## **📌 Step 4: Create Agents**  
```python
# Define Agents
agent1 = Agent(name="Data Collector", role="Fetches product details")
agent2 = Agent(name="AI Categorizer", role="Categorizes products based on AI analysis")
agent3 = Agent(name="Quality Checker", role="Reviews and approves categorization")
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- **agent1**: Collects product details.  
- **agent2**: Categorizes the product.  
- **agent3**: Checks the accuracy of categorization.  

---

## **📌 Step 5: Create Tasks with Attributes**  
```python
# Task 1: Collect Product Details
task1 = Task(
    name="Collect Product Details",
    description="Fetch product information from database",
    agent=agent1,
    expected_output="Product details including name, description, and attributes"
)

# Task 2: Categorize Product
task2 = Task(
    name="Categorize Product",
    description="Analyze product details and assign a category",
    agent=agent2,
    context=[task1],  # Uses task1's output
    expected_output="A product category based on predefined rules",
    output_pydantic=ProductCategoryOutput  # Structured output
)

# Task 3: Review and Approve
task3 = Task(
    name="Approve Categorization",
    description="Verify assigned category and confirm accuracy",
    agent=agent3,
    context=[task2],
    human_input=True,  # Requires human review before approval
    expected_output="Finalized and verified product category",
    output_file="final_category.txt"  # Save output to file
)
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- **task1** → Collects product details.  
- **task2** → Categorizes product **using AI**, taking **task1's output** as context.  
- **task3** → Requires **human review** before finalizing and **saves results** to a file.  

---

## **📌 Step 6: Define the Crew and Execute Tasks**  
```python
# Create a Crew to manage the tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    process=Process.hierarchical  # Assigns tasks based on agent expertise
)

# Execute the workflow
crew.kickoff()
```
🔍 **Explanation:**  
- We create a **Crew** with our **agents and tasks**.  
- We specify a **hierarchical** process, meaning tasks are assigned **based on agent expertise**.  
- We call `crew.kickoff()` to **start execution**.  

---

# 🎯 **4. Summary**  
🚀 **CrewAI Tasks** allow you to:  
✅ Assign tasks to **specific agents** based on expertise.  
✅ Use **context** to pass data between tasks.

# 🚀 **Deep Dive into Task Attributes in CrewAI**  

## 🛠 **What are Task Attributes in CrewAI?**  
In the **CrewAI framework**, a **Task** is not just a simple action—it has multiple attributes that define:  
- **What needs to be done**  
- **Who will perform it**  
- **How the result should be structured**  
- **Whether it needs human intervention**  

By defining these attributes, CrewAI allows for a **structured and efficient** execution of tasks.  

---

# 📌 **Real-World Example of Task Attributes in CrewAI**  
Imagine you're building a **Content Generation AI System** where:  
- **Agent 1 (Writer AI)** generates blog content.  
- **Agent 2 (Editor AI)** proofreads the content.  
- **Agent 3 (Publisher AI)** publishes the article.  

Each step can be structured as a **task** with the right attributes to ensure smooth execution.

# 🔥 **Explanation of the Code**  

✅ **Step 1: Define a Pydantic Model**  
- `BlogPostModel` ensures that the output follows a specific structure (title, content, word_count).  

✅ **Step 2: Create an AI Agent**  
- `content_writer_ai` is an AI agent specializing in blog writing.  

✅ **Step 3: Define a Task with Attributes**  
- The task is about generating a **1000-word blog post**.  
- The task requires **human approval** before finalizing the result.  
- The output will be stored in **generated_blog.txt** and as a **structured JSON**.  
- A **callback function** (`lambda: print("Task completed!")`) is executed when the task finishes.  

✅ **Step 4: Print Task Details**  
- Displays key task information for debugging and tracking.
