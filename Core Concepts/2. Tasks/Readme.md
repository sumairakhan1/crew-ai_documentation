# 🚀 **Managing and Creating Tasks in CrewAI**  

## 📌 **What is a Task in CrewAI?**  
In the **CrewAI framework**, a **Task** is a specific assignment completed by an **Agent**. It contains all the necessary information needed for execution, such as:  
- **Task description**: What needs to be done?  
- **Assigned Agent**: Who will do the task?  
- **Required tools**: What tools are needed to complete the task?  

### 💡 **Key Features of Tasks in CrewAI**  
✅ Tasks can be **simple or complex** depending on the requirements.  
✅ Tasks can be **collaborative**, meaning multiple agents can work together.  
✅ The execution of tasks is managed by the **Crew’s process** to ensure efficiency.  

---

## 🌎 **Real-World Example of CrewAI Tasks**  
### Example: **Customer Support Automation**  
Imagine you are building an **AI-powered customer support system** where:  
- **Agent 1** handles **basic queries**.  
- **Agent 2** manages **technical support**.  
- **Agent 3** is responsible for **escalating unresolved issues**.  

Each **task** in this system represents a specific customer request. The CrewAI framework can ensure that tasks are assigned to the right agents based on their expertise.  

---

# ⚡ **Task Execution Flow in CrewAI**  
Tasks can be executed in **two ways** depending on the workflow requirement:  

## 📌 **1. Sequential Execution**  
- Tasks are executed **one after another**, in the order they are defined.  
- Example:  
  - Step 1: Collect customer data  
  - Step 2: Validate the request  
  - Step 3: Process the request  
  - Step 4: Send response  

## 📌 **2. Hierarchical Execution**  
- Tasks are assigned **based on the agent’s role and expertise**.  
- Example:  
  - A **junior agent** handles basic questions.  
  - A **senior agent** manages advanced queries.  
  - If a query is unresolved, it is escalated to a **manager**.  

---

# 🛠 **Code Example: Creating and Managing Tasks in CrewAI**  

### **Step 1: Install CrewAI**
Make sure you have **CrewAI** installed:  
```bash
pip install crewai
```

### **Step 2: Define Agents**
Agents are AI-powered entities that complete tasks.  
```python
from crewai import Agent

# Create Agents
agent1 = Agent(name="Alice", role="Customer Support Agent", expertise="Basic Queries")
agent2 = Agent(name="Bob", role="Technical Support Agent", expertise="Advanced Issues")
```
**🔍 Explanation:**  
- We create **two agents**:  
  - **Alice** → Handles basic queries.  
  - **Bob** → Handles technical issues.  

---

### **Step 3: Define Tasks**
Tasks define what each agent needs to do.  
```python
from crewai import Task

# Define Tasks
task1 = Task(description="Answer basic customer queries", agent=agent1)
task2 = Task(description="Handle advanced technical support requests", agent=agent2)
```
**🔍 Explanation:**  
- **task1** is assigned to **Alice** (basic queries).  
- **task2** is assigned to **Bob** (technical issues).  

---

### **Step 4: Define the Crew and Execution Process**
We define how tasks should be executed.  
```python
from crewai import Crew, Process

# Define Crew with Agents and Tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential  # or Process.hierarchical
)

# Start the Execution
crew.kickoff()
```
**🔍 Explanation:**  
- We create a **Crew** that consists of the two agents.  
- We assign **tasks** to them.  
- We specify the **execution type** (`Process.sequential` or `Process.hierarchical`).  
- We call `crew.kickoff()` to **start** the execution.  

---

# 🎯 **Final Thoughts**
✅ **CrewAI** makes it easy to create and manage tasks for AI agents.  
✅ Tasks can be executed **sequentially** or **hierarchically** based on the workflow.  
✅ This framework is useful for **customer support, data analysis, automation, and more!**

Imagine an **AI-driven customer support system** where:  
✅ **Agent 1 (FAQ Bot)** answers common questions.  
✅ **Agent 2 (Issue Classifier)** identifies and categorizes customer issues.  
✅ **Agent 3 (Support Representative)** handles complex queries and reports them.  

This setup ensures **efficient, automated** customer interactions with human support only when necessary.

---

# 📌 **1. Creating Tasks in CrewAI**  
CrewAI allows tasks to be **defined in two ways**:  

1️⃣ **Using YAML Configuration (Recommended)** ✅  
2️⃣ **Defining Tasks Directly in Code**  

We'll explore both methods and implement a **customer support AI** that can:  
- **Respond to FAQs**  
- **Classify Customer Issues**  
- **Escalate Issues to Human Support**  

---

# 📝 **2. YAML-Based Task Configuration (Recommended)**  
Using **YAML** keeps task definitions **clean** and **easy to manage**.

### 🛠 **Step 1: Define Tasks in a `tasks.yaml` File**
Create a **tasks.yaml** file inside your project (`src/customer_support/config/tasks.yaml`).

```yaml
faq_task:
  description: >
    Answer frequently asked customer questions about products, delivery,
    and refunds based on pre-defined knowledge.
  expected_output: >
    A concise response to the customer's question, ensuring clarity and accuracy.
  agent: faq_bot

issue_classification_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the customer's query and classify it into categories:
    "Billing", "Technical Issue", "Order Status", or "General Inquiry".
  expected_output: >
    A single category label that best represents the customer's issue.
  agent: issue_classifier

support_task:
  description: >
    If the issue is too complex or requires human involvement, 
    generate a summary report for the human support team.
  expected_output: >
    A structured report including customer details, issue summary, 
    and recommended action.
  agent: support_representative
  output_file: customer_support_report.md
```
### 🔥 **How This Works?**
1. **`faq_task`**: AI bot answers common questions.
2. **`issue_classification_task`**: Categorizes customer issues.
3. **`support_task`**: If required, escalates issues to human support.
