# 2. 2. Creating crews Using YAML Configuration

# 🚀 **Understanding Crews in CrewAI: A Complete Beginner's Guide**  

In this guide, we'll dive deep into how to **create crews in CrewAI** using **YAML configuration** and **decorators** in Python.  
We'll break down complex concepts, explain each line of code, and provide **real-world examples** to make it simple and beginner-friendly.

## 🔍 **What is a Crew in CrewAI?**  
A **crew** in CrewAI is a group of **agents** working together to complete defined **tasks**.  
Think of a crew like a **team of employees in a company**, where each person (agent) has specific responsibilities (tasks).  

---

## 🌟 **Why Use YAML Configuration to Create Crews?**  
✅ Cleaner and more organized code  
✅ Easier to maintain and update  
✅ Consistency across CrewAI projects  

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Example: Content Creation Team**  
Imagine you are running a **content creation agency**. You have:  
- 🖋️ **Writer** (Agent 1) - Creates content  
- 🧹 **Editor** (Agent 2) - Reviews and edits the content  
- 💻 **SEO Specialist** (Agent 3) - Optimizes the content for search engines  

These agents need to perform tasks like writing, editing, and optimizing articles. A **crew** would manage this entire workflow in sequence.  

---

## 📝 **How to Create Crews Using YAML Configuration**  
### ✨ **1. Install and Set Up Your CrewAI Project**  
```bash
pip install crewai
```
*This installs CrewAI so we can start building our project.*  

---

### 🗂️ **2. Define Agents and Tasks in YAML Files**  

#### **agents.yaml**  
```yaml
agent_one:
  name: "Content Writer"
  role: "Generates high-quality blog articles"
  goal: "Produce engaging and SEO-friendly content"

agent_two:
  name: "Content Editor"
  role: "Edits and improves written articles"
  goal: "Ensure content is clear, accurate, and well-structured"
```

#### **tasks.yaml**  
```yaml
task_one:
  name: "Write Article"
  description: "Create a 1500-word article on AI advancements."

task_two:
  name: "Edit Article"
  description: "Review and enhance the article for clarity and SEO."
```

---

### ⚡ **3. Create Your Crew Class with Decorators**  
Let's break down the code **line by line** and understand what's happening:

```python
# Importing necessary classes and decorators from CrewAI
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task, Process
from crewai.project import CrewBase, agent, task, crew, before_kickoff, after_kickoff
```
🔹 *These imports bring in the tools needed to define agents, tasks, and the crew structure.*  

---

### 🛠️ **4. Define the Crew Class**  

```python
@CrewBase
class ContentCreationCrew:
    """This crew handles the content creation workflow from writing to editing."""
```
✅ `@CrewBase`: Marks this class as a crew structure.  
✅ The `"""docstring"""` explains the purpose of this crew.

---

### 📄 **5. Link YAML Configurations**  
```python
    agents_config = 'config/agents.yaml' 
    tasks_config = 'config/tasks.yaml' 
```
🔹 *These variables tell the class where to find agent and task configurations.*  

---

### 🎬 **6. Pre-Processing Inputs (Before Kickoff)**  
```python
    @before_kickoff
    def prepare_inputs(self, inputs):
        # Adding extra info before starting tasks
        inputs['additional_data'] = "Keyword: AI Trends"
        return inputs
```
✅ `@before_kickoff`: Runs this method **before** the crew starts working.  
📌 **Purpose:** Modify inputs like adding extra information needed for the tasks.

---

### 🎬 **7. Post-Processing Outputs (After Kickoff)**  
```python
    @after_kickoff
    def process_output(self, output):
        # Adding extra processing after all tasks finish
        output.raw += "\n[Edited and SEO Optimized!]"
        return output
```
✅ `@after_kickoff`: Runs **after** all tasks are completed.  
📌 **Purpose:** Final touches like adding notes or formatting the output.

---

### 🧑‍💻 **8. Define Agents with @agent Decorator**  
```python
    @agent
    def agent_one(self) -> Agent:
        return Agent(
            config=self.agents_config['agent_one'],
            verbose=True
        )
```
✅ `@agent`: Marks this method as defining an **agent**.  
📌 **Purpose:** Fetches the "Content Writer" configuration from the YAML file.  
🗣️ `verbose=True`: Shows detailed logs of what the agent is doing.

---

### 🎯 **9. Define Tasks with @task Decorator**  
```python
    @task
    def task_one(self) -> Task:
        return Task(
            config=self.tasks_config['task_one']
        )
```
✅ `@task`: Marks this method as defining a **task**.  
📌 **Purpose:** Fetches the "Write Article" task from the YAML file.

---

### 🚀 **10. Assemble the Crew with @crew Decorator**  
```python
    @crew
    def crew(self) -> Crew:
        return Crew(
            agents=self.agents,  # Automatically gathered from @agent methods
            tasks=self.tasks,    # Automatically gathered from @task methods
            process=Process.sequential,  # Execute tasks one after another
            verbose=True,
        )
```
✅ `@crew`: Defines the **final crew** combining agents and tasks.  
📌 **Purpose:** Specifies that tasks should be performed **sequentially** (one after another).  
🗣️ `verbose=True`: Shows the workflow step-by-step in logs.

---

## ⚒️ **How Everything Works Together**  
When you run this crew:  
1️⃣ The **writer** generates an article.  
2️⃣ The **editor** reviews and improves it.  
3️⃣ Extra processing happens after all tasks (like adding SEO notes).  

---

## 💡 **Real-World Use Cases for CrewAI Crews**  
1️⃣ **E-commerce Automation:** Managing product uploads, descriptions, and promotions.  
2️⃣ **Customer Support:** Chatbots for answering FAQs and escalating complex issues.  
3️⃣ **AI Research:** Automating data collection, analysis, and report generation.

| 🚀 **Decorator**        | 🎯 **Purpose**                                     |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `@CrewBase`             | Marks the class as the main crew structure.        |
| `@agent`                | Defines a method that returns an Agent object.     |
| `@task`                 | Defines a method that returns a Task object.       |
| `@crew`                 | Assembles agents and tasks into a Crew object.     |
| `@before_kickoff`       | Executes logic **before** tasks start.             |
