# 💻 **Code Example: Implementing a Crew in CrewAI**  

Let’s create a simple **Crew** that consists of agents performing a document review process.

### **📝 Scenario: Automating Document Review Process**  
Imagine a **legal firm** where:  
✅ One agent **extracts key information** from documents.  
✅ Another agent **verifies and validates** the extracted information.  
✅ A final agent **summarizes the document** for human review.

---

## **1️⃣ Define Agents**  
We first create individual **agents** with different roles.

```python
from crewai import Agent  

# Agent 1: Extractor
extractor_agent = Agent(
    name="Document Extractor",
    role="Extracts key information from documents",
    tools=["Text Extraction Tool"],
    verbose=True
)

# Agent 2: Validator
validator_agent = Agent(
    name="Information Validator",
    role="Validates the extracted information",
    tools=["Verification Tool"],
    verbose=True
)

# Agent 3: Summarizer
summarizer_agent = Agent(
    name="Document Summarizer",
    role="Summarizes the validated information",
    tools=["Summarization Tool"],
    verbose=True
)
```

### **🔍 Explanation:**
1. **`Agent()`**: Creates an AI agent with specific capabilities.
2. **`name`**: Defines the agent’s identity.
3. **`role`**: Describes what the agent does.
4. **`tools`**: Assigns specific tools the agent will use.
5. **`verbose=True`**: Enables detailed logging of agent actions.

---

## **2️⃣ Define Tasks**  
Now, let's create **tasks** and assign them to agents.

```python
from crewai import Task  

# Task 1: Extract key information
extract_task = Task(
    description="Extract key information from legal documents",
    agent=extractor_agent
)

# Task 2: Validate extracted information
validate_task = Task(
    description="Verify and validate extracted legal information",
    agent=validator_agent
)

# Task 3: Summarize document
summarize_task = Task(
    description="Generate a summary of validated legal information",
    agent=summarizer_agent
)
```

### **🔍 Explanation:**
1. **`Task()`**: Creates a task that an agent will perform.
2. **`description`**: Defines what needs to be done.
3. **`agent`**: Assigns an agent to execute the task.

---

## **3️⃣ Create and Run the Crew**  
Now, we organize agents and tasks into a **Crew**.

```python
from crewai import Crew  

# Creating the Crew
document_review_crew = Crew(
    tasks=[extract_task, validate_task, summarize_task],
    agents=[extractor_agent, validator_agent, summarizer_agent],
    process="sequential",
    verbose=True
)

# Running the Crew
document_review_crew.kickoff()
```

### **🔍 Explanation:**
1. **`Crew()`**: Creates a group of agents and tasks.
2. **`tasks`**: List of tasks the Crew will execute.
3. **`agents`**: List of agents forming the Crew.
