# 4. Agent-Specific Knowledge

# 🤖 **Understanding Agent-Specific Knowledge in CrewAI**  

In **CrewAI**, agents can have their **own specialized knowledge sources** instead of relying on shared knowledge at the crew level. This means that each agent can be an expert in its specific area, leading to **better decision-making, efficient information retrieval, and role-specific expertise**.  

Let's break this down in detail so that even a beginner can understand, with **real-world examples, code explanations, and a step-by-step breakdown** of how this concept works.

# 📌 **1. What is Agent-Specific Knowledge?**  

🔍 **Definition:**  
Agent-specific knowledge allows **each agent to have its own knowledge source** using the `knowledge_sources` parameter. Instead of all agents sharing the same knowledge at the crew level, **each agent can have exclusive knowledge relevant to its role.**  

💡 **Why is this important?**  
- ✅ **Specialized Expertise** – Different agents can have different areas of knowledge.  
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** – Prevents unnecessary information sharing between agents.  
- ✅ **Better Organization** – Helps in structuring knowledge in a more modular way.  
- ✅ **Layered Information Access** – Agents can use both crew-level and agent-level knowledge.

# 🌍 **2. Real-World Use Case: Where is Agent-Specific Knowledge Used?**  

📞 **Example: AI-Powered Customer Support System**  

Imagine you have a customer support system powered by AI agents.  
- **Support Agent** – Specializes in product specifications and troubleshooting.  
- **Billing Agent** – Has knowledge about payments, invoices, and refunds.  
- **Shipping Agent** – Knows about delivery times, tracking, and shipping policies.  

Each agent should have **only the knowledge relevant to its domain** to provide accurate responses. This prevents confusion and ensures **efficient task handling**.  

For example, if a customer asks about **laptop storage capacity**, only the **Support Agent** should respond, not the **Billing Agent** or **Shipping Agent**.

# 📝 **3. Code Example: Implementing Agent-Specific Knowledge**  

Let's implement a **technical support agent** with **exclusive product knowledge** about a **Dell XPS 13 laptop**.

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# 🛠️ Step 1: Define agent-specific knowledge (Laptop Specs)
product_specs = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="""The XPS 13 laptop features:
    - 13.4-inch 4K display
    - Intel Core i7 processor
    - 16GB RAM
    - 512GB SSD storage
    - 12-hour battery life""",
    metadata={"category": "product_specs"}  # Metadata for categorization
)

# 🏆 Step 2: Create a Technical Support Agent
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Technical Support Specialist",
    goal="Provide accurate product information and support.",
    backstory="You are an expert on our laptop products and specifications.",
    knowledge_sources=[product_specs]  # Assign agent-specific knowledge
)

# 🎯 Step 3: Define a task for the agent
support_task = Task(
    description="Answer this customer question: {question}",
    agent=support_agent  # Assigning task to the support agent
)

# 🤖 Step 4: Create and run the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[support_agent],  # Add the support agent to the crew
    tasks=[support_task]  # Assign tasks that require product knowledge
)

# 🏁 Step 5: Ask a question about the laptop's specifications
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={"question": "What is the storage capacity of the XPS 13?"}
)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

# 🔍 **4. Code Breakdown & Explanation**
Let's break down each section of the code to understand its purpose:

### **🛠️ Step 1: Defining Agent-Specific Knowledge**
```python
product_specs = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="""The XPS 13 laptop features:
    - 13.4-inch 4K display
    - Intel Core i7 processor
    - 16GB RAM
    - 512GB SSD storage
    - 12-hour battery life""",
    metadata={"category": "product_specs"}
)
```
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- Creates a **knowledge source** containing **laptop specifications**.  
- Uses **metadata** to categorize this knowledge as "product_specs."  
- This knowledge is specific to the **Technical Support Agent**.

---

### **🏆 Step 2: Creating a Technical Support Agent**
```python
support_agent = Agent(
    role="Technical Support Specialist",
    goal="Provide accurate product information and support.",
    backstory="You are an expert on our laptop products and specifications.",
    knowledge_sources=[product_specs]  # Assign agent-specific knowledge
)
```
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- Defines an **AI agent** with the role of a **Technical Support Specialist**.  
- The agent's **goal** is to provide **accurate product details**.  
- Assigns the **product_specs** knowledge source to this agent.

---

### **🎯 Step 3: Defining a Task**
```python
support_task = Task(
    description="Answer this customer question: {question}",
    agent=support_agent
)
```
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- Creates a **task** where the agent answers customer queries.  
- The **{question}** placeholder allows dynamic input.  
- This task is **assigned to the support agent**.

---

### **🤖 Step 4: Creating the Crew**
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[support_agent],  # Add the support agent to the crew
    tasks=[support_task]  # Assign tasks that require product knowledge
)
```
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- Defines a **Crew**, which is a team of AI agents.  
- The **Support Agent** is added to the crew.  
- The crew is assigned **product-related tasks**.

---

### **🏁 Step 5: Running the Crew with a Query**
```python
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={"question": "What is the storage capacity of the XPS 13?"}
)

# Print the result
print(result)
```
✔️ **What This Does:**  
- Calls the `kickoff()` method to **execute the query**.  
- The agent **retrieves information from its knowledge source**.  
- The answer (e.g., **"512GB SSD"**) is returned.

# 🎯 **5. Benefits of Agent-Specific Knowledge**
| ✅ Benefit | 🔍 Explanation |
|------------|--------------|
| **Specialized Information** | Each agent gets **only relevant** knowledge. |
| **Better Accuracy** | Prevents agents from using unnecessary or incorrect information. |
| **Improved Efficiency** | Reduces knowledge processing time. |
| **Scalability** | Easily add more agents with specific knowledge. |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Organizes information by agent roles. |

---

# 📌 **6. Advanced Use Case: Combining Agent & Crew-Level Knowledge**
While each agent can have **its own knowledge**, sometimes **crew-wide knowledge** is needed. You can **combine both** by assigning:  
✅ **Common knowledge at the crew level** (e.g., company policies).  
✅ **Specialized knowledge at the agent level** (e.g., product details for support agents).

🔹 **Example:**  
A **customer service crew** could have:  
- **Crew-Level Knowledge:** General company policies.  
- **Agent-Specific Knowledge:**  
  - 📦 **Support Agent:** Product details.  
  - 💰 **Billing Agent:** Payment & refund policies.  
  - 🚚 **Shipping Agent:** Delivery times & tracking.

# 🎉 **Conclusion**
Agent-specific knowledge in **CrewAI** allows **agents to specialize**, leading to **more accurate responses and efficient information retrieval**.  

🚀 **Key Takeaways:**  
- **Each agent can have exclusive knowledge** relevant to its role.  
- **Prevents confusion** by restricting knowledge to the right agents.  
- **Improves efficiency** in AI-driven applications.
