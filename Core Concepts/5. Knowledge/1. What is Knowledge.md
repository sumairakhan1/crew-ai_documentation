# 🧠 Knowledge in CrewAI – A Beginner-Friendly Guide  

Knowledge in **CrewAI** is a way to provide AI agents with external information so they can make informed decisions and generate more accurate responses. Think of it as giving your AI assistant access to a **library** where it can look up details when needed.  

---

## 🏆 **What is Knowledge in CrewAI?**  

In CrewAI, **Knowledge** refers to external data sources that AI agents can use during their tasks. These knowledge sources help AI agents:  

✅ **Enhance domain expertise** – AI agents can specialize in specific fields (e.g., finance, healthcare).  
✅ **Support decision-making** – AI can refer to stored data for fact-based answers.  
✅ **Maintain context** – Information persists across conversations.  
✅ **Generate factual responses** – Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in real data.  

**Example Use Case:**  
Imagine you're building a **customer support chatbot** for an e-commerce store. Instead of relying only on its pre-trained knowledge, the chatbot can **access stored product details, return policies, and FAQs** to provide accurate responses to customers.

## 🚀 **Getting Started with CrewAI Knowledge**  

To use knowledge in CrewAI, follow these steps:  

1️⃣ **Define a Knowledge Source** (e.g., string, file, or structured data).  
2️⃣ **Create an AI Agent** that will use this knowledge.  
3️⃣ **Assign a Task** to the agent.  
4️⃣ **Create a Crew** with the agent, task, and knowledge source.  
5️⃣ **Execute the Task** and get results.

## 📝 **Code Example: String-Based Knowledge**  

Let’s build a simple **CrewAI system** where an agent has knowledge about a user and answers questions based on that information.  

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process, LLM
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# 1️⃣ Create a knowledge source (text-based)
content = "User's name is John. He is 30 years old and lives in San Francisco."
string_source = StringKnowledgeSource(content=content)

# 2️⃣ Initialize a Language Model (LLM) with temperature 0 (for deterministic answers)
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# 3️⃣ Create an Agent who will use the knowledge source
agent = Agent(
    role="User Information Expert",
    goal="Provide accurate details about the user.",
    backstory="You specialize in remembering user details and answering questions about them.",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
)

# 4️⃣ Define a Task that the Agent will perform
task = Task(
    description="Answer the following questions about the user: {question}",
    expected_output="A factual answer to the question.",
    agent=agent,
)

# 5️⃣ Create a Crew that manages the Agent, Task, and Knowledge
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    knowledge_sources=[string_source],  # Attach the knowledge source here
)

# 6️⃣ Ask the AI a question about the user
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"question": "What city does John live in and how old is he?"})

# 7️⃣ Print the result
print(result)
```

### 🔍 **Understanding the Code**  

✅ **Step 1: Define a Knowledge Source**  
- We create a `StringKnowledgeSource` with user information.  
- This acts like **stored memory** for the AI.  

✅ **Step 2: Initialize the LLM**  
- We use `gpt-4o-mini` with `temperature=0` to **ensure deterministic (consistent) outputs**.  

✅ **Step 3: Create an Agent**  
- The agent has a **role, goal, and backstory** defining its expertise.  
- This agent **does not delegate tasks** and will always answer directly.  

✅ **Step 4: Define a Task**  
- The task tells the agent what to do:  
  - It takes a **user’s question** as input.  
  - It **returns a factual response** based on knowledge.  

✅ **Step 5: Create a Crew**  
- A Crew manages multiple **agents and tasks**.  
- We specify a **sequential process**, meaning tasks are executed **one by one**.  
- The **knowledge source is attached** to make the agent knowledgeable.  

✅ **Step 6 & 7: Execute and Retrieve Answer**  
- The Crew **executes the task** and **retrieves the answer**.  
- If asked `"Where does John live and how old is he?"`, the AI will return:  
  - **"John lives in San Francisco and he is 30 years old."**

## 📌 **Real-World Example: Using Knowledge in Customer Support**  

Let’s say you are building an **AI-powered customer support assistant** for an **e-commerce store**.  

🔹 **Problem:**  
Customers ask about **product details, return policies, and shipping information**. Instead of hardcoding every response, we can **store this knowledge in CrewAI** so the bot can answer based on actual data.  

🔹 **Solution:**  
We can store:  
✅ **Product details** in JSON.  
✅ **Return & refund policies** in a text file.  
✅ **Order tracking information** in a CSV file.  

🔹 **Example Interaction:**  

**Customer:** "What is the return policy for electronics?"  
**AI Response:** "Electronics can be returned within 30 days if unopened. Please provide your order ID for further assistance."  

By **integrating CrewAI Knowledge**, the chatbot provides **instant, accurate responses** without needing predefined answers.
