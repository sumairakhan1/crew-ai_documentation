## 🧠 What is Knowledge in CrewAI?  

Knowledge in **CrewAI** refers to external information that AI agents can use while performing tasks. Instead of relying **only on pre-trained models**, CrewAI enables agents to **fetch and process** information from various sources like **text files, PDFs, CSVs, JSON files, and even online documents**.  

### ✅ **Why Use Knowledge in AI Agents?**  
Using knowledge sources helps AI agents:  
✔ **Enhance responses** with domain-specific data.  
✔ **Answer questions based on real-world facts.**  
✔ **Support decision-making** with structured information.  
✔ **Avoid hallucinations** by grounding responses in real documents.  
✔ **Maintain context** across different interactions.

## 📂 **Types of Knowledge Sources in CrewAI**  

CrewAI supports multiple knowledge sources out of the box:  

| 📜 Source Type  | 🔍 Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **String-Based** | Directly use a string as a knowledge source. |
| **Text Files** (.txt) | Store knowledge in plain text files. |
| **PDF Documents** (.pdf) | Extract and use text from PDFs. |
| **CSV Files** (.csv) | Use structured tabular data. |
| **Excel Files** (.xlsx) | Process spreadsheets with multiple sheets. |
| **JSON Files** (.json) | Fetch and process structured JSON data. |
| **Web Documents** (Docling) | Extract knowledge from online articles or research papers. |

---

## 🚀 **Getting Started with CrewAI Knowledge Sources**  

Before implementing knowledge sources, ensure you have **CrewAI** installed:  

```bash
pip install crewai
```

For **Docling (web document sources)**, install the required library:  

```bash
uv add docling
```

## 🌐 **Using Online Documents as Knowledge Sources (Docling)**  

### 🔹 **Scenario:**  
Imagine you want an AI agent to analyze research papers on **Reward Hacking** and **AI Hallucinations** from online sources.  

### ✅ **Code Implementation**  

```python
from crewai import LLM, Agent, Crew, Process, Task
from crewai.knowledge.source.crew_docling_source import CrewDoclingSource

# 🌍 Step 1: Create a Knowledge Source from Online Documents
content_source = CrewDoclingSource(
    file_paths=[
        "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-11-28-reward-hacking",
        "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination",
    ],
)

# 🧠 Step 2: Define a Language Model (LLM)
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

# 🤖 Step 3: Create an AI Agent with Access to Knowledge
agent = Agent(
    role="Research Paper Expert",
    goal="You know everything about the provided research papers.",
    backstory="""You are a highly knowledgeable AI that specializes in reading and summarizing academic research papers.""",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    llm=llm,
)

# 📋 Step 4: Define a Task for the Agent
task = Task(
    description="Answer the following questions about the research papers: {question}",
    expected_output="An answer to the question with proper references.",
    agent=agent,
)

# 🚀 Step 5: Create a Crew and Assign the Knowledge Source
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,
    knowledge_sources=[content_source],  # Adding the knowledge source
)

# 🎯 Step 6: Run the AI Agent to Answer a Research-Related Question
result = crew.kickoff(
    inputs={
        "question": "What is the reward hacking paper about? Be sure to provide sources."
    }
)
```

## 🔎 **Code Explanation**  

1️⃣ **Define a Knowledge Source** (`CrewDoclingSource`)  
   - We specify **two research paper links** as sources.  
   - The AI will extract and process content from these URLs.  

2️⃣ **Create an LLM**  
   - We use `gpt-4o-mini` with `temperature=0` to ensure **deterministic outputs** (consistent responses).  

3️⃣ **Define an AI Agent**  
   - The agent is responsible for **reading, understanding, and answering questions** about the research papers.  

4️⃣ **Define a Task**  
   - The agent answers **user queries** related to the research papers.  

5️⃣ **Create a Crew**  
   - We add the agent, assign the task, and include the **knowledge source** so that the AI can use it.  

6️⃣ **Execute the AI Workflow**  
   - We provide a question, and the agent **fetches information from the research papers** before answering.
