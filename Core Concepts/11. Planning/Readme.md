# 🚀 **Planning in CrewAI**  
Learn how to add planning to your CrewAI Crew and enhance their performance!  

---

## 🧐 **What is Planning in CrewAI?**  
**Planning** in CrewAI is a feature that enables your AI agents to **organize and strategize tasks** before execution. When enabled, before each iteration of the Crew:  

✔️ **All crew information** (agents, tasks, process) is sent to an **AgentPlanner**.  
✔️ The **AgentPlanner** **creates a step-by-step task plan**.  
✔️ The generated plan is added to **each task description**, helping agents execute them efficiently.  

---

## 🎯 **Why is Planning Important?**  
Without planning, CrewAI agents simply execute tasks sequentially without a structured roadmap. With planning enabled, agents receive **detailed instructions and dependencies**, improving overall performance and decision-making.

## 🌍 **Real-World Use Case: Automated Content Generation Team**  
Imagine you’re running an **automated content generation system** with CrewAI. Your crew includes:  

- ✍️ **Content Writer Agent** – Writes blog articles.  
- 🖼 **Image Generator Agent** – Creates visuals for the article.  
- 📢 **SEO Optimizer Agent** – Improves the article for search rankings.  

With **planning enabled**, CrewAI will:  
1️⃣ Understand the dependencies (e.g., text must be written before images are generated).  
2️⃣ Plan a **step-by-step execution** of these tasks.  
3️⃣ Ensure smooth task coordination, improving efficiency.

# 🔧 **How to Enable Planning in CrewAI?**  

Enabling **planning** is simple! You only need to **set `planning=True`** when creating a Crew.  

### 📝 **Basic Example – Enabling Planning in CrewAI**  

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,   # List of AI agents
    tasks=self.tasks,     # List of tasks assigned to agents
    process=Process.sequential,  # Tasks will execute sequentially
    planning=True,        # Enable planning feature
)
```

### 🔍 **Code Breakdown:**  
- **`Crew`** – Defines the AI crew with multiple agents.  
- **`agents=self.agents`** – Specifies a list of agents involved in the task execution.  
- **`tasks=self.tasks`** – Defines the list of tasks assigned to agents.  
- **`process=Process.sequential`** – Ensures tasks are performed one after the other.  
- **`planning=True`** – Enables **automated task planning**.  

✅ Now, before executing tasks, CrewAI will **plan them properly**!

# 🧠 **Using a Custom Planning LLM**  

By default, CrewAI uses a **built-in planning model**. However, you can **specify a different AI model (e.g., GPT-4o) to improve planning quality**.  

### ✨ **Example – Custom Planning Model in CrewAI**  

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning and a custom LLM
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,   # List of AI agents
    tasks=self.tasks,     # List of tasks assigned to agents
    process=Process.sequential,  # Tasks will execute sequentially
    planning=True,        # Enable planning feature
    planning_llm="gpt-4o" # Use GPT-4o as the planning LLM
)

# Run the crew
my_crew.kickoff()
```

### 🔍 **Code Breakdown:**  
- **`planning_llm="gpt-4o"`** – Specifies the AI model that will handle task planning.  
- **`my_crew.kickoff()`** – Starts the crew, executing tasks based on the planned strategy.  

✅ With **GPT-4o**, CrewAI will **generate smarter, optimized, and well-structured task plans**!  

---

# 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  
✔️ **Planning in CrewAI** ensures tasks are executed in a structured, optimized manner.  
✔️ It **prepares a step-by-step task breakdown** before execution.  
✔️ You can **customize the planning AI model** for better results.  
✔️ Helps in **real-world automation**, such as content creation, customer support, and AI-driven workflows.  

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**
Try enabling **planning in CrewAI** for your own AI-powered workflows and see how it improves performance! 🎉

### 📝 **Code Output for Planning in CrewAI**  
When you enable **planning**, CrewAI will generate **a step-by-step task plan** before execution. Below is an example of how the output might look when running the **planning-enabled CrewAI**.

---

## 🔹 **Code Execution:**
```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Create agents
agent_writer = Agent(name="Content Writer")
agent_designer = Agent(name="Image Designer")
agent_seo = Agent(name="SEO Optimizer")

# Create tasks
task_write = Task(description="Write a blog post about AI trends", agent=agent_writer)
task_design = Task(description="Create an infographic for the blog post", agent=agent_designer)
task_seo = Task(description="Optimize the blog post for search engines", agent=agent_seo)

# Assemble the Crew with planning enabled
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent_writer, agent_designer, agent_seo],  # Define agents
    tasks=[task_write, task_design, task_seo],  # Assign tasks
    process=Process.sequential,  # Execute tasks one after another
    planning=True,  # Enable planning feature
    planning_llm="gpt-4o"  # Use GPT-4o for intelligent planning
)

# Run the crew
my_crew.kickoff()
```

---

## 🖥 **Code Output (Simulated)**
When running the above CrewAI script, the **AgentPlanner** will generate a structured plan like this:

```
🔄 CrewAI Planning Initialized...
📋 Generating step-by-step task execution plan...

✅ Step 1: Content Writer will start writing the blog post on "AI trends".
✅ Step 2: Once the blog post is complete, the Image Designer will create an infographic.
✅ Step 3: After the infographic is ready, the SEO Optimizer will optimize the blog for search engines.

🚀 Crew Execution Started...
📝 Content Writer: Writing a blog post on AI trends... ✅ Completed!
🎨 Image Designer: Creating an infographic for the blog post... ✅ Completed!
📈 SEO Optimizer: Optimizing the blog for search engines... ✅ Completed!

🎉 All tasks completed successfully!
```

---

## 🔍 **Explanation of Output:**
- **"🔄 CrewAI Planning Initialized..."**  
  → CrewAI starts **planning tasks** before execution.
- **"📋 Generating step-by-step task execution plan..."**  
  → The **AgentPlanner** creates an optimized task execution order.
- **"✅ Step 1, Step 2, Step 3..."**  
  → Each step represents a **planned sequence of execution**.
- **Execution Logs ("📝, 🎨, 📈")**  
  → Shows agents executing their respective tasks.
- **"🎉 All tasks completed successfully!"**  
  → Indicates that the crew **executed tasks in a planned manner**.
