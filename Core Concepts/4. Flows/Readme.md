from litellm import completion

class ExampleFlow(Flow):
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"

    @start()
    def generate_city(self):
        print("Starting flow")
        print(f"Flow State ID: {self.state['id']}")

        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": "Return the name of a random city in the world."},
            ],
        )

        random_city = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        self.state["city"] = random_city
        print(f"Random City: {random_city}")

        return random_city

    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}"},
            ],
        )

        fun_fact = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
        self.state["fun_fact"] = fun_fact
        return fun_fact

flow = ExampleFlow()
result = flow.kickoff()

print(f"Generated fun fact: {result}")
```

---

## 🛠 **Breaking Down the Code**  

### 🎯 **1. Defining the Flow Class**
- We define a **Flow** class called `ExampleFlow` that extends `Flow`.  
- It specifies `model = "gpt-4o-mini"` to use OpenAI’s GPT model.  

### 🎯 **2. Creating the First Task: `generate_city`**
- This method generates a **random city name** using OpenAI.  
- It prints the **flow state ID**, which helps track the execution.  
- The city name is stored in the state for future use.  

### 🎯 **3. Creating the Second Task: `generate_fun_fact`**
- This method listens for the **output of `generate_city`**.  
- It then asks OpenAI to generate a **fun fact about that city**.  
- The fun fact is stored in the state.  

### 🎯 **4. Running the Flow**
- The `flow.kickoff()` method starts the execution.  
- The **random city and fun fact** are printed to the console.  

---

## 📌 **How CrewAI Flows Manage State**  

- **Unique Flow State ID:** Each Flow instance gets a **UUID** to track execution.  
- **Data Storage:** The `self.state` dictionary stores important data like city names and fun facts.  
- **State Persistence:** The stored data persists throughout the workflow execution, allowing for seamless information sharing between tasks.  

---

# 🚀 **Understanding CrewAI Flows Code – Line by Line Explanation**  

This code creates an **AI workflow** using `CrewAI Flows`. The workflow consists of two tasks:  
1️⃣ **Generating a random city** using OpenAI's model  
2️⃣ **Generating a fun fact** about that city  

Let’s break it down **step by step** in an easy-to-understand way!  

---

## 📌 **1. Importing Required Modules**  
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
```
🔹 **Why?** This imports the core functionalities of `CrewAI Flows`:  
- `Flow`: Base class for creating workflows  
- `start`: Marks the beginning of a flow  
- `listen`: Listens for a specific task's completion before executing  

---

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```
🔹 **Why?** Loads environment variables (like API keys) from a `.env` file so that **we don’t expose sensitive data** in our code.

---

```python
from litellm import completion
```
🔹 **Why?** `litellm` is a library used to interact with OpenAI’s language models (like GPT).  
- The `completion()` function sends a request to an AI model and gets a response.

---

## 📌 **2. Defining the AI Workflow Class**
```python
class ExampleFlow(Flow):
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `ExampleFlow` is our **custom workflow**  
- It **inherits** from `Flow`, meaning it gets all features of `Flow`  
- We will define tasks inside this class

---

```python
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- Defines which AI model to use (`gpt-4o-mini` in this case)  
- This model will be used for generating text responses  

---

## 📌 **3. Task 1: Generating a Random City**
```python
    @start()
    def generate_city(self):
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `@start()` means **this is the first function** that runs when the workflow starts  
- `generate_city(self)` is a method that will generate a random city  

---

```python
        print("Starting flow")
```
🔹 **Why?** Just prints a message so we know the workflow has started.

---

```python
        print(f"Flow State ID: {self.state['id']}")
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `self.state['id']` is a **unique identifier** for each workflow execution  
- It helps track multiple runs of the flow  

---

### **Calling OpenAI’s API to Generate a Random City**
```python
        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": "Return the name of a random city in the world."},
            ],
        )
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `completion()` sends a request to OpenAI  
- It asks the AI: **"Return the name of a random city in the world."**  
- The AI will respond with a city name  

---

### **Extracting and Storing the Generated City**
```python
        random_city = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- The API response is a dictionary  
- We extract the generated city’s name from it  

---

```python
        self.state["city"] = random_city
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `self.state` is **persistent storage** in the workflow  
- We store the `random_city` so it can be used later  

---

```python
        print(f"Random City: {random_city}")
```
🔹 **Why?** Prints the city name for debugging or logging.

---

```python
        return random_city
```
🔹 **Why?** Returns the city name so the next function can use it.

---

## 📌 **4. Task 2: Generating a Fun Fact About the City**
```python
    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, random_city):
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `@listen(generate_city)` means **this function will run only after `generate_city` completes**  
- `random_city` is **the output of `generate_city`**, passed as an argument  

---

### **Calling OpenAI’s API to Get a Fun Fact**
```python
        response = completion(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Tell me a fun fact about {random_city}"},
            ],
        )
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- Sends a request to OpenAI  
- The AI is asked: **"Tell me a fun fact about [random city]"**  
- The AI responds with a fun fact  

---

### **Extracting and Storing the Fun Fact**
```python
        fun_fact = response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```
🔹 **Why?** Extracts the fun fact from the AI’s response.

---

```python
        self.state["fun_fact"] = fun_fact
```
🔹 **Why?** Stores the fun fact so it can be used later.

---

```python
        return fun_fact
```
🔹 **Why?** Returns the fun fact so it can be printed or used elsewhere.

---

## 📌 **5. Running the Flow**
```python
flow = ExampleFlow()
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- Creates an instance of `ExampleFlow`  
- Now the workflow is **ready to be executed**  

---

```python
result = flow.kickoff()
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- `kickoff()` **starts the workflow execution**  
- It runs `generate_city`, waits for it to complete, then runs `generate_fun_fact`  

---

```python
print(f"Generated fun fact: {result}")
```
🔹 **Why?**  
- Prints the final **fun fact** returned by `generate_fun_fact`  

---

## 🌍 **Real-World Use Case**
### **Where Can This Be Used?**
🎯 **Travel Applications**  
- A travel website can use this to **suggest random cities and fun facts** to travelers.  

🎯 **Education Apps**

## 🎉 **Now You Understand CrewAI Flows!**
This was a **step-by-step breakdown** to help you easily understand **how AI workflows work** in CrewAI. 🚀  
Would you like to modify this example for a different use case? 😊

# 🚀 Understanding `@start()` and `@listen()` in CrewAI Flow  

CrewAI Flow is a structured way to manage AI-driven tasks in a sequential or event-driven manner. Two essential decorators, `@start()` and `@listen()`, help define how tasks interact within a Flow. Let's break these concepts down for beginners, using real-world examples and simple explanations.

---

## 🔥 `@start()` – The Beginning of a Flow  

### 📌 **What is `@start()`?**  
The `@start()` decorator marks a method as the **starting point** of a Flow. When the Flow is initiated, all methods with `@start()` execute **in parallel**.  

### 🏗 **How it Works**  
Think of a Flow as a factory production line. The `@start()` method is like turning on the machines – it's the **first step** that sets everything in motion.  

### ✍ **Example Usage**  
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, start

class ExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def generate_city(self):
        print("Flow has started!")
        return "Paris"

flow = ExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- `@start()` ensures `generate_city()` runs **when the Flow starts**.  
- The function simply prints a message and returns a city name.  
- `flow.kickoff()` triggers the execution.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Imagine you are building a **travel suggestion app**.  
- `@start()` can be used to **pick a random city** for the user when they launch the app.  
- Then, other methods in the Flow can fetch details like **fun facts, best hotels, or flight prices** based on the chosen city.

---

## 👂 `@listen()` – Listening for Outputs  

### 📌 **What is `@listen()`?**  
The `@listen()` decorator marks a method as a **listener** for the output of another method in the Flow. When the **specified method completes**, the listener method automatically runs and processes its output.  

### 🏗 **How it Works**  
Think of it like a **domino effect**. When one task finishes, it **triggers** the next step in the process.  

### ✍ **Example Usage**
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class ExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def generate_city(self):
        return "Tokyo"

    @listen(generate_city)
    def generate_fun_fact(self, city_name):
        return f"A fun fact about {city_name}: Tokyo has the busiest train station in the world!"

flow = ExampleFlow()
result = flow.kickoff()
print(result)
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- `generate_city()` returns `"Tokyo"`.  
- `generate_fun_fact()` **listens** to `generate_city()` and **uses its output (`city_name`)** to generate a fact.  
- The `flow.kickoff()` method executes the Flow, triggering the chain of actions.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Imagine an **AI-powered news bot** that listens for breaking news updates.  
- The `@start()` method **fetches a trending topic** (e.g., "New AI Model Released").  
- The `@listen()` method **analyzes the news** and generates a **summary** or key takeaways.

---

## 🎯 Different Ways to Use `@listen()`

### ✅ **1. Listening by Method Name (String Format)**  
You can **refer to a method by name** using a string.
```python
@listen("generate_city")
def generate_fun_fact(self, city_name):
    return f"Amazing fact about {city_name}!"
```
✔ **Use case:** When your Flow has **many methods**, this approach makes it easy to reference them without worrying about function names.

### ✅ **2. Listening by Passing the Method Directly**  
You can **directly pass the method** instead of using a string.
```python
@listen(generate_city)
def generate_fun_fact(self, city_name):
    return f"Amazing fact about {city_name}!"
```
✔ **Use case:** This is more Pythonic and **helps avoid typos** in method names.

---

## 🏆 Retrieving Flow Outputs  

### 📌 **Why is Output Handling Important?**  
When a Flow completes, we need a way to **access the final result**. The `kickoff()` method returns the last executed method’s output.  

### ✍ **Example Usage**
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class OutputExampleFlow(Flow):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        return "Flow started"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self, first_output):
        return f"Processed output: {first_output}"

flow = OutputExampleFlow()
final_output = flow.kickoff()
print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- `first_method()` starts and returns `"Flow started"`.  
- `second_method()` **listens** to the output and **processes it further**.  
- `final_output` stores the last executed method’s result.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Consider an **e-commerce order tracking system**:  
- `@start()` → Gets the **order details**.  
- `@listen()` → Fetches **delivery status updates** when the order moves through different locations.

---

## 🔄 **Managing State in a Flow**  

### 📌 **What is State?**  
State allows methods in the Flow to **store and share data**. Instead of passing values manually, methods can update and retrieve shared information.  

### ✍ **Example Usage**
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StateExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):
    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        self.state.message = "Step 1 completed"
        self.state.counter += 1

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.message += " → Step 2 completed"
        self.state.counter += 1
        return self.state.message

flow = StateExampleFlow()
final_output = flow.kickoff()

print(f"Final Output: {final_output}")
print(f"Final State: {flow.state}")
```
**📝 Explanation:**  
- The `state` stores a `counter` and a `message`.  
- Each method **updates the state**, making the data available globally within the Flow.  
- This is useful when multiple steps **need to remember previous results**.

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Consider a **loan approval system**:  
- `@start()` → Collects **applicant details**.  
- `@listen()` → Updates **loan eligibility status** based on **credit score, income, and loan amount**.  
- **State tracks** the **progress of the application** from "Received" → "Under Review" → "Approved".

---

# 🎯 Key Takeaways  
✅ **`@start()`** → Marks the **beginning** of a Flow, running **in parallel**.  
✅ **`@listen()`** → **Waits for a task to complete**, then processes its output.  
✅ **`kickoff()`** → **Triggers the Flow** and returns the final output.  
✅ **State Management** → Allows **data sharing** between methods.  

---

# 🌟 Final Thoughts  
Using `@start()` and `@listen()` in CrewAI Flows helps **structure AI-powered applications** by defining **clear task dependencies**. Whether you’re building a **chatbot, automation system, or AI-driven analytics tool**, these concepts **simplify workflow execution** and make AI tasks **more organized and efficient**. 🚀

Here’s a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation of **Flow State Management in CrewAI**, including **real-world applications**, **key concepts**, and **examples** to help you understand how it works.  

---

# 🚀 **Flow State Management in CrewAI: A Beginner-Friendly Guide**

Managing state efficiently is crucial for building **reliable and maintainable** AI workflows. **CrewAI Flows** provide two major ways to handle state:  

✅ **Unstructured State Management** (flexible but dynamic)  
✅ **Structured State Management** (predefined schema for consistency)  

Understanding **how and when to use each approach** helps ensure your AI workflows run smoothly and integrate well into larger applications.  

---

## 🏗️ **What is State Management?**
Before diving into CrewAI’s state management, let's first understand **what "state" means** in an AI workflow.  

- **State** refers to the **stored information** that a workflow uses and updates during execution.  
- It helps **track progress**, **store temporary data**, and **share results between different methods** in a flow.  

Example:  
Imagine you’re building an AI **customer support chatbot**. The chatbot needs to remember:  
✔️ The **user’s previous questions**  
✔️ Whether **they have been answered**  
✔️ Any **pending actions**  

State management helps the chatbot keep track of this information throughout the conversation.  

---

## 🔄 **Unstructured State Management: A Flexible Approach**
🔹 **Unstructured state management** allows you to store data **without a predefined schema**.  
🔹 The state is stored in a **dictionary-like format** (`self.state`).  
🔹 CrewAI **automatically** assigns a **unique identifier (UUID)** to each state instance.  

### 📝 **How It Works**
- You can **add new attributes** to `self.state` **dynamically**.  
- No need to define a **fixed structure** in advance.  
- Great for **simple workflows** where state can change frequently.  

### 🧑‍💻 **Code Example: Unstructured State**
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start

class UnstructuredExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        # CrewAI automatically assigns a unique ID to each state
        print(f"State ID: {self.state['id']}")
        self.state['counter'] = 0
        self.state['message'] = "Hello from unstructured flow"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state['counter'] += 1
        self.state['message'] += " - updated by second_method"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state['counter'] += 1
        self.state['message'] += " - updated again by third_method"
        print(f"State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = UnstructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```
### ✅ **Key Features of Unstructured State**
✔️ **Flexibility** – No predefined structure; add attributes dynamically.  
✔️ **Simplicity** – Great for small or rapidly changing workflows.  
✔️ **Automatic UUID** – The system assigns a unique **ID** to track state instances.  

### 🌍 **Real-World Example: Where to Use It?**
🔸 **Data Processing Pipelines** – Where data attributes might **change dynamically** based on the input.  
🔸 **Chatbot Sessions** – Keeping track of messages **without needing a fixed structure**.  

---

## 🏛️ **Structured State Management: A More Organized Approach**
🔹 **Structured state management** uses **predefined schemas** to store data in a **structured format**.  
🔹 It ensures **type safety** and **consistency** using **Pydantic models**.  
🔹 Like unstructured state, CrewAI **automatically generates a UUID** for each state.  

### 📝 **How It Works**
- The state is defined using a **Pydantic model** (like a class).  
- Each state instance **follows a strict format** with defined **data types**.  
- **Easier to maintain** in large workflows.  

### 🧑‍💻 **Code Example: Structured State**
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    # Note: A unique 'id' is automatically assigned to each state
    counter: int = 0
    message: str = ""

class StructuredExampleFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def first_method(self):
        print(f"State ID: {self.state.id}")  # Access unique ID
        self.state.message = "Hello from structured flow"

    @listen(first_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated by second_method"

    @listen(second_method)
    def third_method(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        self.state.message += " - updated by third_method"
        print(f"Final State after third_method: {self.state}")

flow = StructuredExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```
### ✅ **Key Features of Structured State**
✔️ **Predefined Schema** – Ensures that state follows a **fixed structure**.  
✔️ **Type Safety** – Helps prevent **errors** caused by incorrect data types.  
✔️ **Better IDE Support** – Enables **auto-completion** and **error checking**.  

### 🌍 **Real-World Example: Where to Use It?**
🔸 **E-commerce Order Processing** – Where each order has a **fixed set of attributes** (ID, total amount, status).  
🔸 **AI Model Training Pipelines** – To track model parameters in a **structured way**.  

---

# 🆚 **Comparison: Unstructured vs. Structured State**
| Feature                  | Unstructured State 🛠️ | Structured State 🏛️ |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Flexibility**          | ✅ High              | ❌ Low (Fixed schema) |
| **Ease of Use**          | ✅ Simple            | ❌ Requires setup    |
| **Type Safety**          | ❌ Not enforced      | ✅ Enforced with Pydantic |

# 🔥 **Flow Persistence in CrewAI – A Deep Dive for Beginners**  

Managing the state of an AI workflow is essential for building reliable applications. One crucial aspect of state management is **persistence**, which ensures that the system can maintain state across restarts or workflow executions. CrewAI provides a **@persist** decorator to enable automatic state persistence, preventing data loss and allowing workflows to resume seamlessly.  

In this guide, we will break down **Flow Persistence** step by step, explain its working mechanism, and discuss real-world applications where it can be useful.  

---

## 📌 **What is Flow Persistence?**  
Flow persistence allows you to **save** and **restore** workflow state even after an application restarts or crashes. CrewAI provides an inbuilt **@persist** decorator to persist state **automatically**.  

### ✅ **Why is Flow Persistence Important?**  
- 🌍 **Prevents Data Loss** – Ensures workflow progress is not lost on restart.  
- 🚀 **Allows Workflow Resumption** – AI tasks can pick up where they left off.  
- 🔍 **Tracks Execution State** – Maintains data consistency.  
- 🔄 **Supports Both Structured & Unstructured State Management** – Works with both predefined models (Pydantic) and flexible dictionary-based states.  

---

# 🏛 **Types of Flow Persistence in CrewAI**  

CrewAI offers two levels of persistence:  
1. **Class-Level Persistence** – Saves the state for the entire class.  
2. **Method-Level Persistence** – Saves the state for specific methods only.  

---

## 🏛 **1. Class-Level Persistence** (Applies to Entire Workflow)  
When **@persist** is used at the **class level**, all the methods inside the class will have their states automatically saved and restored.  

### ✅ **How It Works:**  
- The state persists across all methods in the class.  
- On restart, the flow automatically retrieves its last saved state.  
- Uses **SQLiteFlowPersistence** by default to store data in a local SQLite database.  

### 📝 **Example: Class-Level Persistence**  
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai.flow.persistence import persist
from pydantic import BaseModel

class MyState(BaseModel):
    counter: int = 0

@persist  # Persist the entire class state
class MyFlow(Flow[MyState]):

    @start()
    def initialize_flow(self):
        self.state.counter = 1
        print("Initialized flow. State ID:", self.state.id)

    @listen(initialize_flow)
    def next_step(self):
        self.state.counter += 1
        print("Flow state is persisted. Counter:", self.state.counter)

flow = MyFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```
### 🎯 **Key Benefits of Class-Level Persistence:**  
✅ Automatically persists the entire class state.  
✅ Best for long-running workflows with multiple steps.  
✅ Ideal for AI pipelines, chatbots, or sequential workflows.  

---

## 🛠 **2. Method-Level Persistence** (Applies to Specific Methods)  
Instead of persisting the whole class, you can **persist individual methods** where needed.  

### ✅ **How It Works:**  
- Only the state of the method where **@persist** is applied will be saved.  
- Other methods in the class will **not** be persisted.  
- Useful for workflows where **only specific steps need persistence**.  

### 📝 **Example: Method-Level Persistence**  
```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from crewai.flow.persistence import persist

class AnotherFlow(Flow[dict]):

    @persist  # Persist only this method's state
    @start()
    def begin(self):
        if "runs" not in self.state:
            self.state["runs"] = 0
        self.state["runs"] += 1
        print("Method-level persisted runs:", self.state["runs"])

flow = AnotherFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```
### 🎯 **Key Benefits of Method-Level Persistence:**  
✅ Provides **fine-grained control** over what gets persisted.  
✅ Avoids **unnecessary data storage**, improving efficiency.  
✅ Useful in **transactional workflows** where only specific steps need persistence.  

---

# 🔍 **How Does Flow Persistence Work Internally?**  
Behind the scenes, CrewAI **automatically assigns a unique ID (UUID)** to each flow state.  

### 🛠 **How State is Managed:**  
✅ **Each flow state gets a unique UUID.**  
✅ **The state is stored in a local SQLite database by default.**  
✅ **Even after failure or restart, CrewAI reloads the previous state.**  

### 📂 **Default Storage: SQLite Backend**  
- CrewAI uses **SQLiteFlowPersistence** by default to store state.  
- The state is **saved automatically** and **reloaded when needed**.  
- If the database has errors, CrewAI provides **clear error messages**.  

---

# 🚨 **Error Handling in Flow Persistence**  
CrewAI includes **robust error handling** for state persistence.  

✅ **Database Errors** – If SQLite fails, clear error messages help debugging.  
✅ **State Validation** – Ensures structured states (Pydantic) are valid before saving.  
✅ **Automatic Recovery** – If a flow crashes, it **reloads** the last saved state.  

### 📝 **Example: Handling Persistence Errors**  
```python
try:
    flow.kickoff()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error during flow execution: {e}")
```

---

# 🌎 **Real-World Use Cases of Flow Persistence**  

### 🏥 **1. AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis Systems**  
- A healthcare AI system diagnosing patients must **persist state** if the doctor switches between cases.  
- Example: If an AI chatbot assists with symptom analysis, it should **resume from the last question** instead of restarting.  

### 💬 **2. AI Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**  
- AI chatbots must **remember previous conversations** to provide meaningful responses.  
- **Without persistence**, every session would restart from scratch.  

### 📈 **3. Financial Transaction Processing**  
- A **banking workflow** that processes transactions should not lose progress if interrupted.  
- Example: If a system failure occurs after step 2 in a 5-step transaction process, **the state should be saved and resumed**.  

### 🎮 **4. Gaming and AI Decision Trees**  
- AI-powered **NPC behavior in games** should **remember previous decisions** to make **intelligent choices**.  
- Example: In an AI-powered chess game, the opponent's state should **persist** between moves.  

---

# 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  

✅ **Flow Persistence** ensures state is maintained across restarts or failures.  
✅ **@persist decorator** is used for both **class-level** and **method-level** persistence.  
✅ **Automatic state storage** in SQLite by default.  
✅ **Error handling and state validation** improve reliability.  
✅ **Real-world applications** include AI chatbots, banking systems, and medical diagnosis tools.  

---

# 🚀 **Conclusion**  
Flow persistence in CrewAI provides **a powerful way to manage and retain state**, making AI workflows more reliable and robust. Whether you're building an AI chatbot, financial transaction system, or game AI, **persisting state ensures your application runs smoothly even when interruptions occur**.

# 🛠️ Flow Control in CrewAI: A Beginner-Friendly Guide  

Flow control in **CrewAI Flows** helps manage how different methods interact and execute based on specific conditions. This ensures that workflows are **structured, efficient, and dynamic** based on various inputs and outputs.

This guide will break down the key **flow control mechanisms** used in CrewAI Flows:  
✅ **Conditional Logic: `or_`**  
✅ **Conditional Logic: `and_`**  
✅ **Router-based Conditional Flow (`@router`)**  

We will explain each concept in detail with **examples, real-world use cases, and simplified explanations** for beginners.  

---

## 🚦 Conditional Logic: `or_`  

### 🔹 What is `or_`?  
The `or_` function allows a method to **listen to multiple other methods** and trigger only when **any one of them** emits an output.  

### 🧑‍💻 How It Works?  
1. **Define multiple methods** that can generate output.  
2. **Use `or_`** to listen for outputs from multiple methods.  
3. **The listener method executes** when any of the specified methods produce an output.  

### 📝 Example Code  

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, or_, start

class OrExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        return "Hello from the start method"

    @listen(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        return "Hello from the second method"

    @listen(or_(start_method, second_method))
    def logger(self, result):
        print(f"Logger: {result}")

flow = OrExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

### 📌 Output  
```
Logger: Hello from the start method
Logger: Hello from the second method
```

### 🌍 Real-World Example  
**Scenario:**  
Imagine a **customer service chatbot** that responds to different triggers.  

🔹 If the user **asks for help** (`help_request`) OR **files a complaint** (`complaint`), the chatbot should **send a notification to the support team**.  

```python
@listen(or_(help_request, complaint))
def notify_support():
    print("📢 Support team notified!")
```

---

## 🚦 Conditional Logic: `and_`  

### 🔹 What is `and_`?  
The `and_` function ensures that a method is triggered **only when all specified methods have emitted an output**.  

### 🧑‍💻 How It Works?  
1. **Multiple methods must execute first.**  
2. **The `and_` function ensures that all of them have completed successfully.**  
3. **Only then will the final listener method execute.**  

### 📝 Example Code  

```python
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, and_, listen, start

class AndExampleFlow(Flow):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        self.state["greeting"] = "Hello from the start method"

    @listen(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        self.state["joke"] = "What do computers eat? Microchips."

    @listen(and_(start_method, second_method))
    def logger(self):
        print("---- Logger ----")
        print(self.state)

flow = AndExampleFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

### 📌 Output  
```
---- Logger ----
{'greeting': 'Hello from the start method', 'joke': 'What do computers eat? Microchips.'}
```

### 🌍 Real-World Example  
**Scenario:**  
Imagine a **bank loan approval system** where a customer must meet **two conditions**:  

✅ **Credit score check**  
✅ **Income verification**  

Only if **both checks pass**, the system will approve the loan.  

```python
@listen(and_(credit_check, income_verification))
def approve_loan():
    print("✅ Loan Approved!")
```

---

## 🔀 Router-Based Conditional Flow (`@router`)  

### 🔹 What is `@router`?  
The `@router` decorator **directs execution based on dynamic conditions**. This is useful when we need **different paths based on input values**.  

### 🧑‍💻 How It Works?  
1. **The `@router` method processes some input and returns a decision.**  
2. **Other methods listen to specific outputs** of the router and execute accordingly.  

### 📝 Example Code  

```python
import random
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, router, start
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ExampleState(BaseModel):
    success_flag: bool = False

class RouterFlow(Flow[ExampleState]):

    @start()
    def start_method(self):
        print("Starting the structured flow")
        random_boolean = random.choice([True, False])
        self.state.success_flag = random_boolean

    @router(start_method)
    def second_method(self):
        if self.state.success_flag:
            return "success"
        else:
            return "failed"

    @listen("success")
    def third_method(self):
        print("✅ Third method running: Success path")

    @listen("failed")
    def fourth_method(self):
        print("❌ Fourth method running: Failure path")

flow = RouterFlow()
flow.kickoff()
```

### 📌 Output (Random)  
```
Starting the structured flow
✅ Third method running: Success path
```
OR  
```
Starting the structured flow
❌ Fourth method running: Failure path
```

### 🌍 Real-World Example  
**Scenario:**  
Consider an **order processing system** that determines whether an order is valid or fraudulent.  

🔹 **Step 1:** Verify payment.  
🔹 **Step 2:** If payment is valid, confirm the order. Otherwise, reject the order.  

```python
@router(payment_verification)
def order_status():
    if payment_success:
        return "confirmed"
    else:
        return "rejected"

@listen("confirmed")
def confirm_order():
    print("✅ Order Confirmed!")

@listen("rejected")
def reject_order():
    print("❌ Order Rejected!")
```

---

## 🏆 Key Takeaways  

### ✅ `or_` - Trigger when **any one** of multiple methods emits an output.  
🔹 **Example:** Customer service chatbot alerts support for **either help requests or complaints.**  

### ✅ `and_` - Trigger when **all** specified methods emit an output.  
🔹 **Example:** Loan approval system requiring **both credit score and income verification.**  

### ✅ `@router` - Directs execution based on **conditions**.  
🔹 **Example:** Order processing system that determines **whether to confirm or reject an order.**

# 🚀 **Understanding How to Add Crews to Flows in CrewAI**  

CrewAI allows developers to create AI-driven workflows by organizing tasks into logical units called **"crews."** If you are working on complex automation, you might need multiple crews to manage different aspects of your workflow. This guide will take you through the process of adding multiple crews to flows in **CrewAI**, explaining the structure, commands, and real-world applications.  

---

## 🏗 **1. What is a Crew in CrewAI?**  

In **CrewAI**, a *crew* is a group of **agents** working together to perform specific tasks within a workflow. These agents are configured in YAML files and execute predefined tasks to automate processes.  

💡 **Example:**  
Think of a **crew** as a team inside a company. Each crew has a specific role—one may handle customer support, another manages billing, and another works on marketing. All these teams together form the complete company workflow.  

---

## ⚡ **2. Creating a Flow with Multiple Crews**  

CrewAI provides a simple way to create a new flow with multiple crews using a single command:  

```bash
crewai create flow name_of_flow
```

🔹 **What this command does:**  
✅ It generates a new **CrewAI project** with all the required files and folders.  
✅ It includes a **prebuilt crew** called **"poem_crew"**, which serves as a template.  
✅ You can duplicate and modify this template to create additional crews.  

🔹 **Example Use Case:**  
Suppose you want to build an AI system that **writes, edits, and publishes blog articles automatically**. You can create three crews:  
1️⃣ **Writer Crew** - Generates the article content.  
2️⃣ **Editor Crew** - Reviews and improves the content.  
3️⃣ **Publisher Crew** - Formats and publishes the article on a website.  

---

## 📂 **3. Folder Structure in a CrewAI Flow**  

Once you run the `crewai create flow` command, CrewAI sets up the following project structure:  

📁 **Project Folder (name_of_flow/)**  
📂 **crews/** – Contains all the different crews in your project.  
   📂 **poem_crew/** – A prebuilt crew for demonstration purposes.  
   📂 **config/** – Configuration files for defining agents and tasks.  
   📜 `agents.yaml` – Defines agents (AI workers) in this crew.  
   📜 `tasks.yaml` – Defines tasks assigned to agents.  
   📜 `poem_crew.py` – The main Python script for this crew’s functionality.  
   
📂 **tools/** – Directory for additional tools used in the flow.  
   📜 `custom_tool.py` – Example of a custom tool.  

📜 **main.py** – The main script that runs the entire flow.  
📜 **README.md** – Documentation for the project.  
📜 **pyproject.toml** – Defines project dependencies and settings.  
📜 **.gitignore** – Specifies files to exclude from version control.  

🔹 **Real-World Analogy:**  
Imagine you are managing a **movie production company**. Each **crew** represents a different department:  
🎬 **Screenwriting Crew** – Writes scripts.  
🎥 **Filming Crew** – Shoots scenes.  
🎞 **Editing Crew** – Processes footage.  
📢 **Marketing Crew** – Promotes the movie.  

By organizing your AI workflows into **multiple crews**, you can automate complex processes efficiently.

---

## 🛠 **4. How to Add More Crews to a Flow?**  

To create additional crews:  
1️⃣ **Copy the existing "poem_crew" directory.**  
2️⃣ **Rename it** to something meaningful (e.g., "blog_writer_crew").  
3️⃣ **Modify `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`** to define new agents and tasks.  
4️⃣ **Update `main.py`** to include the new crew.  

---

## 🌍 **5. Real-World Use Cases of Multi-Crew Flows**

✅ **Build and define crews** in a structured way.  
✅ **Connect multiple crews** in a flow using `main.py`.  
✅ **Run and visualize** AI workflows for optimization.  

---

# 🏗 **1. Building Your Crews in CrewAI**  

### 📂 **What is a Crew?**  
A **crew** in CrewAI is like a **team of AI agents** working together to accomplish a task. Each crew has:  
✅ **Agents** - AI-powered workers that execute tasks.  
✅ **Tasks** - Specific jobs assigned to agents.  
✅ **Crew Definition** - The logic that ties agents and tasks together.  

### 📁 **Folder Structure of a Crew**  
When you create a crew, it is stored in the `crews/` folder with a predefined structure.  

🔹 Example: **poem_crew** (a crew that generates poetry)  
```
crews/
  ├── poem_crew/
  │   ├── config/
  │   │   ├── agents.yaml   # Defines the AI agents for this crew
  │   │   ├── tasks.yaml    # Defines tasks assigned to the agents
  │   ├── poem_crew.py      # Main script defining crew logic
```
💡 **Tip:** You can **copy, paste, and modify** an existing crew folder to create new crews.  

---

# 🔗 **2. Connecting Crews in main.py**  

Once you've defined multiple crews, you need to connect them into a workflow. This is done using the **Flow class** inside `main.py`.  

### 📜 **Example: Connecting poem_crew in main.py**
The following script creates a workflow where:  
1️⃣ A **sentence count** is generated randomly.  
2️⃣ The **PoemCrew** generates a poem based on the sentence count.  
3️⃣ The **poem is saved** to a text file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
from random import randint
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai.flow.flow import Flow, listen, start
from .crews.poem_crew.poem_crew import PoemCrew

# 📝 State Management for the Flow
class PoemState(BaseModel):
    sentence_count: int = 1
    poem: str = ""

class PoemFlow(Flow[PoemState]):
    # Step 1️⃣: Generate a random sentence count
    @start()
    def generate_sentence_count(self):
        print("Generating sentence count")
        self.state.sentence_count = randint(1, 5)

    # Step 2️⃣: Use PoemCrew to generate a poem
    @listen(generate_sentence_count)
    def generate_poem(self):
        print("Generating poem")
        result = PoemCrew().crew().kickoff(inputs={"sentence_count": self.state.sentence_count})
        print("Poem generated", result.raw)
        self.state.poem = result.raw

    # Step 3️⃣: Save the generated poem to a file
    @listen(generate_poem)
    def save_poem(self):
        print("Saving poem")
        with open("poem.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write(self.state.poem)

# 🚀 Run the flow
def kickoff():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.kickoff()

# 📊 Generate a plot of the flow
def plot():
    poem_flow = PoemFlow()
    poem_flow.plot()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    kickoff()
```

### 🎯 **Key Concepts in the Code:**
✅ `@start()` - Defines the first step of the flow.  
✅ `@listen(previous_step)` - Connects steps together in sequence.  
✅ `kickoff()` - Executes the workflow.  
✅ `plot()` - Generates a **visual representation** of the workflow.  

💡 **Example Use Case:** You can modify this to build **different AI-powered workflows**, like an **article writer**, a **chatbot**, or an **automated email responder**.

# 🚀 Next Steps: Exploring CrewAI Flow Examples

If you're interested in learning more about how CrewAI flows work in real-world applications, here are four practical examples. Each example demonstrates a unique use case, helping you understand how to apply CrewAI flows effectively.  

---

## 📧 **1. Email Auto Responder Flow**  
This example demonstrates an **infinite loop** where a background job continuously runs to **automate email responses**. It's an ideal use case for tasks that need to be performed repeatedly without human intervention.  

### 🔹 **How It Works**
- The system listens for incoming emails.  
- Based on predefined rules (e.g., keywords in subject/body), it generates an automatic response.  
- The response is sent back to the sender, and the cycle continues.  

### 🏢 **Real-World Example**  
🔹 **Customer Support Bot**: Many companies use automated email responders for customer support. When a customer submits a query, the bot instantly sends a response, such as FAQs or ticket confirmation, before a human agent takes over.  

---

## 🎯 **2. Lead Score Flow**  
This flow **incorporates human feedback and dynamic decision-making** to evaluate and prioritize leads using a scoring system. It uses **conditional branches (routers)** to handle different cases.  

### 🔹 **How It Works**
- A new lead is entered into the system.  
- An AI algorithm scores the lead based on various factors (e.g., past interactions, email engagement, purchase history).  
- If the score is high, the lead is passed to the sales team. Otherwise, it is nurtured through automated emails.  
- A human can review and adjust the lead score, improving future recommendations.  

### 🏢 **Real-World Example**  
🔹 **CRM Lead Management**: Sales teams use lead scoring to focus on the most promising customers. For instance, in HubSpot or Salesforce, AI-driven lead scoring helps identify potential high-value customers and prioritize them.  

---

## 📖 **3. Write a Book Flow**  
This example chains multiple crews together to automate the book-writing process. One crew generates an outline, and another crew writes detailed chapters based on the outline.  

### 🔹 **How It Works**
- A **planning crew** generates a book outline based on a topic.  
- A **writing crew** develops each chapter following the outline.  
- A **review crew** checks for consistency and quality.  
- The final content is compiled into a structured book.  

### 🏢 **Real-World Example**  
🔹 **AI-Powered Content Creation**: AI-assisted book-writing tools like Jasper or ChatGPT-powered workflows can help authors quickly generate book drafts. This is useful for technical documentation, self-publishing, and content marketing.  

---

## 🤖 **4. Meeting Assistant Flow**  
This flow triggers multiple follow-up actions after a meeting concludes, making it perfect for **task automation and team collaboration**.  

### 🔹 **How It Works**
