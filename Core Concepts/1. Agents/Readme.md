## 🛠️ **How to Create and Manage Agents in CrewAI**  

Let’s dive into a **step-by-step code example** to see how we can create and manage agents using Python and CrewAI.  

### 🚀 **Step 1: Install CrewAI**  
Before coding, you need to install the **CrewAI** library.  
```bash
pip install crewai
```
🔍 *This command installs the CrewAI framework, making all its features available in your Python environment.*

---

### 🧑‍💻 **Step 2: Create an Agent**  

Let’s create a **Researcher Agent** that can collect AI-related news.

```python
from crewai import Agent

# Creating a Researcher Agent
researcher_agent = Agent(
    name="AI Researcher",
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Gather the latest news articles related to Artificial Intelligence.",
    tools=["web_scraper", "news_api"],
    memory=True
)

# Output agent details
print(f"Agent Created: {researcher_agent.name} - Role: {researcher_agent.role}")
```

### 🔍 **Code Breakdown:**  
1️⃣ **Importing Agent**  
```python
from crewai import Agent
```
- ✅ *We import the `Agent` class from the CrewAI library.*  

2️⃣ **Defining the Researcher Agent**  
```python
researcher_agent = Agent(
    name="AI Researcher",
    role="Researcher",
    goal="Gather the latest news articles related to Artificial Intelligence.",
    tools=["web_scraper", "news_api"],
    memory=True
)
```
- 🏷️ **name:** The name of the agent.  
- 🛡️ **role:** The responsibility of the agent (here, it's researching).  
- 🎯 **goal:** The main objective for this agent.  
- 🛠️ **tools:** Tools the agent can use, like APIs.  
- 🧠 **memory:** If `True`, the agent remembers past interactions.  

3️⃣ **Printing Agent Details**  
```python
print(f"Agent Created: {researcher_agent.name} - Role: {researcher_agent.role}")
```
- 🖨️ *Prints out the agent’s name and role to confirm creation.*

---

### 🏃 **Step 3: Running the Agent's Task**  
Let’s run the agent so it performs its job.  

```python
# Simulate the agent performing a task
result = researcher_agent.perform_task(
    task="Collect top 5 AI news articles from today."
)

# Output the result
print("Researcher Agent Results:", result)
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**  
- 🔄 **perform_task():** This method tells the agent to execute a task.  
- 📄 **task parameter:** Defines what we want the agent to do (e.g., collect AI news).  
- 🖨️ **Print result:** Shows the result after the task completion.

---

### 🤝 **Step 4: Making Agents Collaborate**  

Now, let’s create a **Writer Agent** that will write an article based on the research.

```python
# Creating a Writer Agent
writer_agent = Agent(
    name="AI Writer",
    role="Writer",
    goal="Write an engaging blog post about the latest AI news.",
    tools=["text_generator"],
    memory=True
)

# Writer Agent using Researcher Agent's results
article = writer_agent.perform_task(
    task=f"Write a detailed blog post based on this research: {result}"
)

print("Writer Agent's Article:\n", article)
```

### 📝 **Code Explanation:**  
1️⃣ **Writer Agent:**  
- Same as the Researcher but focused on writing content.  

2️⃣ **Collaboration:**  
- The Writer agent uses the **Researcher’s output** (`result`) to create an article.

## 🧠 **3. Memory and Context Management**  

### 🧩 **Why Memory and Context Are Important?**  
Agents often need to **remember previous interactions** to handle multi-step workflows or provide contextually relevant responses.

---

### 💡 **Key Practices:**  
1. **Enable Memory**: Use `memory=True` for tasks that span multiple steps.  
2. **Domain Knowledge**: Use `knowledge_sources` for specialized tasks.  
3. **Custom Templates**: Define templates for consistent communication.

---

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Building a **healthcare advisor agent** that:  
- 👩‍⚕️ Remembers a patient's previous symptoms.  
- 💊 Suggests follow-up treatments based on history.

---

### 💻 **Code Example: Context-Aware Agent**  

```python
from crewai import Agent

# 🧠 Memory-enabled healthcare advisor agent
healthcare_agent = Agent(
    role="Healthcare Advisor",
    goal="Provide personalized healthcare advice based on patient history.",
    memory=True,    # 🧠 Remembers previous conversations
    knowledge_sources=["medical_guidelines.json"],  # 📚 Uses domain-specific knowledge
    system_template="As a {role}, I aim to {goal}.",
    prompt_template="Patient reported: {input}. How should I proceed?",
    response_template="Based on your previous symptoms '{input}', I recommend the following:",
    verbose=True
)
```

| **Code**                           | **Purpose**                                                                |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `memory=True`                       | 🧠 Enables memory so agent **remembers previous interactions**.             |
| `knowledge_sources=[...]`           | 📚 Adds **domain-specific knowledge** for better recommendations.           |
| `system_template`, `prompt_template`| ✍️ **Defines communication style** for more human-like interactions.         |

## 🤝 **4. Agent Collaboration**  

### 🌟 **Why Should Agents Collaborate?**  
For **complex projects**, you may want multiple agents working together, sharing tasks like research, development, and testing.

---

### 💡 **Key Practices:**  
1. **Enable Delegation**: Let agents assign tasks to each other.  
2. **Monitor Interactions**: Use `step_callback` to track progress.  
3. **Use Specialized Models**: Assign different models for reasoning and tool usage.

---

### 🌍 **Real-World Example**  
Imagine building an **AI development team**:  
- 🔍 **Research Agent**: Gathers the latest AI papers.  
- 💻 **Development Agent**: Implements algorithms.  
- 🧪 **Testing Agent**: Tests performance metrics.

---

### 💻 **Code Example: Collaborative Agents**  

```python
from crewai import Agent

# 🔍 Research agent
researcher = Agent(
    role="AI Researcher",
    goal="Research the latest AI technologies.",
    allow_delegation=True,  # 🤝 Can assign tasks to other agents
    verbose=True
)

# 💻 Development agent
developer = Agent(
    role="AI Developer",
    goal="Implement researched AI algorithms efficiently.",
    verbose=True
)

# 🧪 Testing agent
tester = Agent(
    role="AI Tester",
    goal="Test and validate AI models for performance.",
    verbose=True
)
```

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔄 **Rate Limiting**       | Too many API calls                          | Set `max_rpm`, enable `cache`, or batch requests.       |
| 🧱 **Context Errors**       | Token limit exceeded                        | Use `respect_context_window`, clear memory periodically.|
| ❌ **Code Execution Fails** | Missing Docker or permission issues          | Install Docker, check sandbox settings.                |
| 🎭 **Memory Inconsistency** | Memory not enabled or misconfigured          | Enable `memory=True`, check knowledge sources.         |
